		Follow-on/Secondary Offering	Usually less than one month before pricing date	Filing will specify a maximum $ amount being offered and placeholders for # of shares and price	Medium	Companies may use S-1 instead of a shelf (S-3) to register a follow-on/secondary public offering, which would normally result in a price decline depending on the pricing and offering terms. If no PR prior to filing, then the market will interpret this as new information and price will decline. Market will fully price in the offering once PR of pricing is announced.	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649009/000121390021065218/ea152193-f1_siyatamobileinc.htm

	EFFECT	Filed when SEC has officially finished review of filing	Usually within one month of S-1/F-1, S-3/F-3, F-10, but longer when co is smaller, has complex financials, or foreign. All EFFECTs are bulk publicly disclosed at 6:00AM daily, even if received earlier. Small cap S-1/F-1 offerings almost always priced on day of EFFECT.	Check which filing it's linked to by clicking the file number	Low-Medium	EFFECT is required before an S-1/F-1 related offering can be priced, a shelf can be used, or resale shares be fully registered and sold. Will have biggest market impact when market is unsure of exact date of pricing for small cap discounted S-1 offering, since public disclosure of EFFECT for S-1/F-1 offering means pricing is imminent.	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649009/999999999522000075/xslEFFECTX01/primary_doc.xml
	S-1/F-1MEF	Up-size prior offering	After EFFECT and shortly before pricing	Check which filing it's linked to by clicking the file number	Low-Medium	Co can decide to upsize up to 20% more than max $ amount previously specified even after receiving EFFECT.

If they offer right away, then it can have material price impact. There is also no limit on the $ amount for this shelf.

Usually filed throughout course of business so market will not know if the company will use immediately. Normally no market impact on filing. Will have impact if it's more obvious co will use immediately, such as filing after a big run up and needs cash badly. Sometimes filed with 424B3.	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1389002/000119312521251940/d164824d424b5.htm

		Amend prior filing	When there is additional material disclosure required	First page will mention amendment	None	Usually filed if new material development occurs while prior S-1/F-1 filing is still active.

	RW	Withdrawal of registration filing	After initial filing and whenever co wants to withdraw it	Check which filing it's linked to by clicking the file number	Low-Medium	Co may decide to withdraw a prior registration such as S-1 or S-3. If the market was already partially pricing in an offering such as one signaled by an S-1, then the public disclosure of RW may cause a pop because it signals that the company is cancelling the offering.
